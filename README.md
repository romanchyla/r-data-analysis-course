This is a private repository of mine, I keep here my work and notebooks from the Coursera Data analysis course. I do not publish answers to homeworks before their deadline, nor share solutions before the deadline is due. 

But I do believe that peer-review is very important for learning and for science in general, so I keep it here, accessible to everyone.
